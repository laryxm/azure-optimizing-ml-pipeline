    "# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.\n",
    "In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.\n",
    "This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data set\n",
    "The \"Bank Marketing\" data set contains information about direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.\n",
    "In this project we seek to predict if the client would subscribe to a specif bank product ('yes') or not ('no'). The product studied was related to bank term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. \"The best performing model was a ...\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The best model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scikit-learn Pipeline\n",
    "**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## AutoML\n",
    "**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline comparison\n",
    "**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future work\n",
    "**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of cluster clean up\n",
    "**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**\n",
    "**Image of cluster marked for deletion**"
